## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## MVP Limitations

- **Data Persistence**: User accounts and watchlists are stored in-memory and will be reset if the backend server restarts.
- **Mock Data**: Market data, predictions, and news are currently generated by mock services to avoid API rate limits during development.
